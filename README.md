# User Login
A login system that allows the user to create an account, then hashes the password and stores it in a database. When creating the account, the program will check if your username or password is a duplicate in the database. If it is approved, the user can then enter their login information afterwards and the system will query the database to check if the credentials are correct. I used SQLite3 to manage 
the database and SHA256 as the hash function.

I did this project to help myself learn about hashing and working with databases in Python.
