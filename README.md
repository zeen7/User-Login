# User Login
A login system that allows the user to create an account, then hashes the password and stores it in a database. The user can enter their 
login information afterwards and the system will query the database to check if the credentials are correct. I used SQLite3 to manage 
the database and SHA256 as the hash function.

I did this project to help myself learn about hashing and working with databases in Python.
